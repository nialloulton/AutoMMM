## Overview

AutoMMM is a groundbreaking tool that revolutionizes the process of building and optimizing Marketing Mix Models. Utilizing advanced Ridge Regression and the GPT-4 AI model, AutoMMM offers a seamless and automated approach to feature selection and model creation.

## Take Control of Your Marketing Efforts

AutoMMM empowers marketers by identifying potential predictors in your Marketing-Mix Model. By leveraging the power of AI and domain expertise, it assists with variable selection, multicollinearity management, and model performance improvement, enabling you to optimize your marketing investments for maximum return.

## Innovative Features for Enhanced Performance

AutoMMM combines domain expertise with statistical criteria like AIC, T-stats, and coefficients sign for an effective automated variable selection process. It uses AI to suggest new variables and Ridge Regression alpha parameter, enhancing your model performance.

## Customize and Understand Your Model

With AutoMMM, you have the flexibility to customize initial variables, initial alpha, and the number of iterations. It provides insights into variable usage, identifying key variables used more than average in the candidate models. Plus, it returns the average alpha parameter used in the models to help manage multicollinearity.

## Explore Further with Holiday Extraction and Bayesian VAR

AutoMMM's robust features include holiday extraction and variable creation, processing into any weekly week format, and Bayesian VAR with an exogenous component. It also provides an Impulse Response Function and plotting for the Bayesian VAR class.

## Detailed Description
The automodeller method in this code is an experimental approach to model selection and improvement, particularly for marketing mix models. It uses a combination of domain expertise and a language model (GPT) to iteratively improve the model based on various statistical metrics like AIC, R-squared, T-stats, and more.

Here's a high-level explanation of how the automodeller works:

- The method starts by fitting an initial Ridge Regression model using the given dataset, target variable, and the alpha parameter.
- It calculates various statistical metrics like AIC, R-squared, T-stats, VIF, etc., which are crucial for model evaluation and variable selection.
- A prompt is constructed using these statistical metrics to ask the language model for advice on improving the model. This prompt includes a detailed summary of the current model, its performance, and its variables. It also asks the language model to consider the practical implications of variable selection and the importance of domain knowledge.
- The language model (GPT) processes the prompt and responds with suggestions for new variables to consider and, if appropriate, a new alpha parameter for Ridge Regression.
- The automodeller incorporates the language model's suggestions, updates the variables and alpha parameter, and fits a new Ridge Regression model.
- This iterative process continues until the model converges to a satisfactory solution based on both statistical and practical considerations, or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.
- Throughout this process, the automodeller ensures that it does not overfit the model or select variables that do not make sense in the context of a marketing mix model. The goal is to find a model with the best balance of performance (highest R-squared and lowest AIC) and practical relevance, considering the impact of media channels, price, distribution, and other relevant factors.
